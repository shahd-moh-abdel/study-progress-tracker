# Study Progress Tracker

this is the way I used to study in the past, to see which lesson I reveiw more than once. This is the way I like to do active recall.

I didn't find an app that does the exact thing I want so I made it :)

## what can you do with it (at least for now)

- you can add a new lesson (once you study it)
- you can add a review
- sign in with google (you can use it without sign in)

## what I used in this app

- react with ts
- firebase
- and some other packages check package.json :)

## what is next

- I want to add subjects to organize it
- I want to add a filter obtion to see what lessons you didn't review for a while

If you have any suggestions feel free to add them! =D

_side note_ this is my first time using TS don't judge <3
